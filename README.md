## About me
I am Ashmit, a student from Vellore Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialized focus in Cloud Computing and Automation 

## Technical Skills
- **Languages** : C++ , GoLang , Python , Kotlin , SQL
- **Libraries / Frameworks** : Gin , Micronaut 
- **Tools & Technologies** : Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) ,Kafka , Conduktor, Git , GitHub , gRPC , Protocol Buffers , ClickHouse
- **Coursework** - Object Oriented Programming , Operating System , Database Management System

## Projects
#### AI Codebase Generator using Golang
- **Automation:** Built a code generation CLI tool that takes user prompts and dynamically generates full project structures using the OpenAI API.
- **Concurrency:** Implemented a multi-worker file writing system using Go channels and `sync.WaitGroup`  to ensure efficient parallel task execution.
- **Parsing:** Designed a custom parser to extract multiple files from AI-generated responses, handling format errors gracefully for robust project creation.
- **Integration:** Integrated OpenAIâ€™s GPT model with a Go-based file generation pipeline, enabling seamless end-to-end development from prompt to project

#### Ticket System using Go and Gin 
- **RESTful API:** Developed a RESTful API backend using Go (Golang) and the Gin web framework, implementing full CRUD operations across 12 endpoints.
- **Database:** Integrated SQLite as the lightweight relational database solution, with structured data models and efficient query handling.
- **Authentication:** Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints, manage session tokens, and enforce access restrictions for users.
- **Authorization:** Implemented logic to ensure users can only modify resources they own, such as allowing only the event creator to update or delete that specific event.
- **Design:** Ensured code maintainability by organizing functionality into modular handlers, middleware, and routing, following RESTful design principles.

#### Performance Comparison between parallel and sequential execution**
  - Executed three geoemtric algorithms in both parallel and sequential environment to note down the difference in execution time
  - Used OpenMP to simulate parallel processing environment
  - **Polygon Triangulation** : Implemented Polygon Triangulation using Ear Clipping Method
  - **Convex Hull Representation** : Found the convex hull for a given set of co-ordinates using Gift Wrapping Algorithm
  - **MST** - Parellized Kruskal Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for a given graph
