## Introduction
I am Ashmit, a student from Vellore Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialised focus in Cloud Computing and Automation 

## Technical Skills
- **Languages** : C++ , GoLang , SQL , Python
- **Libraries / Frameworks** : Gin , HTTP
- **Tools** : Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) , Git , GitHub
- **Coursework** - Object Oriented Programming , Operating System , Database Management System

## Projects
#### Performance Comparison between parallel and sequential execution**
  - Executed three geoemtric algorithms in both parallel and sequential environment to note down the difference in execution time
  - Used OpenMP to simulate parallel processing environment
  - **Polygon Triangulation** : Implemented Polygon Triangulation using Ear Clipping Method
  - **Convex Hull Representation** : Found the convex hull for a given set of co-ordinates using Gift Wrapping Algorithm
  - **MST** - Parellized Kruskal Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for a given graph

#### Ticket System using Go and Gin 
  - Implemented a REST API for a ticket management system using SQLite database
  - Designed and implemented RESTful endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving ticket details,while optimizing performance through efficient database queries.
  - Developed a feature for updating ticket information (such as availability and event details) in real-time, using SQLite to ensure accurate and synchronized data across all user interactions

#### Scheduling and Paging Algorithms 
  - **Scheduling Algorithms** : Designed and implemented more than 3 core CPU scheduling algorithms including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Multi-Level Queue Scheduling in a C++ operating system   project, improving process efficiency and resource management.
  - **Paging Algorithms** : Developed and optimized 3 paging algorithms such as Optimal Page Replacement (OPR), Least Recently Used (LRU), and Second Chance, enhancing memory management
  - **Object Oriented Design** :  Applied advanced C++ techniques and OOP principles, leveraging optimized data structures for rapid data access and streamlined code management
